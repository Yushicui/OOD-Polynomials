# Polynomial Algebra and Operations - Object-Oriented Design

### <br>**Overview**<br>
This project offers an implementation that models one-variable polynomials, with integral coefficients, and defines several algebraic operations associated with them. Through the provided interface and its subsequent implementation, users can construct, evaluate, compare, and perform polynomial addition in an intuitive and straightforward manner.

### **Core Components**

**Polynomial Interface:**<br>
- Serves as the foundational blueprint for the polynomial operations and characteristics.
- Defines methods such as addTerm, getDegree, getCoefficient, evaluate, isSame, and add to support term management, polynomial characteristics, and operations.

**PolynomialImpl Class:**<br>
- Implementation of the Polynomial interface that handles the core logic of polynomial operations and maintains polynomial terms.
- Stores only terms with non-zero coefficients in decreasing order of their powers.
- Features two constructors: A default constructor that initializes an empty polynomial and a string-based constructor that parses a given string to create a polynomial object.

### **Key Takeaways**<br>
- Strong Encapsulation: Through the interface and its implementation, the project encapsulates polynomial operations and details, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
- Flexible Constructors: The provision of multiple constructors in the PolynomialImpl class allows ease in polynomial creation, either from scratch or from a string representation.
- Immutable Design: The add operation doesn't mutate existing polynomial objects, showcasing the importance of immutability in data structures.
- Exception Handling: The system is designed to handle incorrect inputs, like negative powers, ensuring robustness and user-friendly error messages.

### **Summary**<br>
The project serves as a comprehensive representation of polynomial algebra. The design focuses on modularity, user-friendly operations, and data integrity. With the combined power of the Polynomial interface and the PolynomialImpl class, users get a robust system for polynomial operations.
